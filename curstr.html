            <h1><abbr title="A Dance of Fire and Ice">ADOFAI</abbr> String Cursed Levels by Yangsy56302</h1>
            <hr/>
        </div>
        <h2>General</h2>
            <h3>Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    Each ADOFAI level may correspond to an curse effect <i>(theoretically)</i>. The IDs of the two are the same.<br/>
                    Using a curse effect may produces many possibilities of results. Just choose a specific one to use.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>In the following content, midspins will be considered as 0° angle.</p>
            <h3>Formats</h3>
            <p>
                The curses should be hinted by using text decorations on the bottom of the interface:
                <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: 12-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: XT-X</div><br/>
                <i>(and yes, that's why the name of this cursed levels series is <b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str">string</a></b>!)</i>
            </p>
                <p>
                    There will be a countdown before updating the current curse effects.<br/>
                    The countdown starts with 3, decreases by 1 in equal interval time.<br/>
                    The curse effects will be updated <b>at the exact same time</b> when the number <i>should be</i> counted down to -1.<br/>
                    <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: ML-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 5-X (3)</div>
                    <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: ML-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 5-X (2)</div>
                    <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: ML-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 5-X (1)</div>
                    <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: ML-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 5-X (0)</div>

                <h4>Keywords</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">...</a></b> stands for "please wait", or "needs more info" occasionlly.
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: XC-X + ...<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: ...</div>

                        <b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration">StopIteration</a></b> stands for "that was the last curse state change, you can take a break now".

                    </p>
            <h3>Mechanisms</h3>
                <h4>Basics</h4>
                    <p>Curse effects is usually regarded as a chart-to-chart <b>mapping</b> at here.</p>
                    <p>
                        Curse effects can <b>stack</b>:
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: XR-X + 12-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 12-X + XR-X</div><br/>
                    </p>
                <h4>Advanced</h4>
                    <p>
                        The affect order of stacked curse effects is from left to right. For example:
                        <p>
                            <b>XR-X + 12-X</b> will first add triangles,<br/>
                            then try to change the angle of every tile,<br/>
                            including those tiles that is a part of these new triangle,<br/>
                            so now these triangles are probably not triangles anymore;<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            but <b>12-X + XR-X</b> will first try to change the angle of every tile,<br/>
                            then add triangles which will not be modified by the angle change process thats already finished.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                <h4>Meta</h4>
                    <p>
                        Curse effects can also stack on themselves.
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: XS-X + XS-X + XS-X + XS-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: XS-X<span class="curstr*">*</span>6</div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Anticurse</b> can be used to reverse the effect of a curse, as long as that part is possible to have an reversed version which is possible to form the current part if you use the original curse to it.<br/>
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: 8<span class="curstr+">+</span>X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 9-X + 9<span class="curstr+">+</span>X</div><br/>
                        <i>(when i said reverse, i didn't mean simply negate the values, although it may be equivalent; i mean <b>negate the whole process</b>)</i><br/>
                        Using an anticurse may produces many possibilities of results which is totally different with the original chart, or does not match expectations at all. Just choose a specific one to use as I mentioned before.<br/>
                    </p>
        <h2>Main Game</h2>

                Green ones are allowed;<br/>
                Yellow ones are allowed by the curse but you will be killed by judgement itself;<br/>
                Red ones are NOT allowed and you will be killed instantly by the curse.
            </p>
            <h3>2-X</h3> <p><b>Rhythm Change:</b><br/>3/4, 7/8, 4/5, etc.</p>

                You starts with N = 0.<br/>
                Every time you reached the end of a chain of 180° tiles, the tile right after the chain needs to hit N extra times;<br/>
                After that, N increased by 1.
            </p>
            <h3>4-X</h3> <p><b>Short:</b><br/>Remove segments at any scale.</p>
            <h3>5-X</h3> <p><b>April Fools:</b><br/>The planets are in the wrong orientation yet the chart plays the exact same as it did before.</p>

                <i>(0° and 360° may also counts, it depends. this effect can also adding or removing twirls on a 180° tile for better readability)</i>
            </p>
            <h3>9-X</h3> <p>Every tile that its angle is not an integer multiple of 90° will have a twirl, even if it already has one.</p>
            <h3>10-X</h3>
            <p>
                Twirls will be added on a tile when its angle is bigger than 180°.<br/>
                <i>(this effect can also adding or removing twirls on a 180° tile for better readability)</i>
            </p>

            <h3>12-X</h3> 
            <p>
                <b>Mirror Symmetry:</b><br/>
                The angle of each tile is now its supplementary angle.<br/>
                <i>(integer multiples of 180° will bypass this curse; angles bigger than 180°will be moduled by 180° when processing. this effect can also adding or removing twirls for better readability)</i>
            </p>
        <h2>Xtra/Challenge</h2>
            <h3>B-X</h3> <p>Every tile is doubled <i>(except the end portal)</i>.</p>

            <p>
                If the center of two <i>(or more)</i> tiles was overlapped with each other, The planet will choose the shortest path <i>(in time, not in tile count)</i> to walk on.<br/>
                <i>(if there is a tie, either option is acceptable)</i>

            <h3>XR-X</h3>
            <p>
                If a 90° tile is not a part of an triangle, give it one.<br/>
                <i>(Blue Archive can also be included, but you should use BA as a curse if that's is the only thing that you included)</i>
            </p>
            <h3>XN-X</h3> <p>Multiplied the BPM by 2/3 and change the planet counts to 3, without changing the shape of the chart.</p>
