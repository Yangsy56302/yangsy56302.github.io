        <h2>General</h2>
            <p>The curses should be hinted by using text decorations on the bottom of the interface:</p>
            <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: 10-X + 11-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 12-X</div>
            <p>Curse effects is usually regarded as a chart-to-chart mapping at here.</p>
            <p>Curse effects can stack: the order is from left to right. Curse effects can also stack on themselves.</p>
            <p>
                Anticurse (like) can be used to reverse the effect of a curse, as long as that part is possible to have an reversed version which is possible to form the current part if you use the original curse to it.<br/>
                <i>(when i said reverse, i didn't mean simply negate the values, although it may be equivalent; i mean <b>negate the whole process</b>)</i>
            </p>
            <p>In the following content, midspins will be considered as 0° angle.</p>

                <b>Stricted Judgement:</b><br/>

                You starts with N = 0.<br/>
                Every time you reached the end of a chain of 180° tiles, the tile right after the chain needs to hit N extra times;<br/>
                After that, N increased by 1.
            </p>
            <h3>4-X</h3> <p><b>Short:</b><br/>Remove segments at any scale.</p>
            <h3>5-X</h3> <p><b>April Fools:</b><br/>The planets are in the wrong orientation yet the chart plays the exact same as it did before.</p>

                Every chain of NOT 180° tiles will be extended by 1.<br/>
                <i>(0° and 360° may also counts, it depends. this effect can also adding or removing twirls on a 180° tile for better readability)</i>
            </p>
            <h3>9-X</h3> <p>Every tile that its angle is not an integer multiple of 90° will have a twirl, even if it already has one.</p>
            <h3>10-X</h3>
            <p>
                Twirls will be added on a tile when its angle is bigger than 180°.<br/>
                <i>(this effect can also adding or removing twirls on a 180° tile for better readability)</i>
            </p>
            <h3>11-X</h3> <p>Red Twirl = Speed Up, Blue Twirl = Speed Down.</p>

                The angle of each tile is now its supplementary angle.<br/>
                <i>(integer multiples of 180° will bypass this curse; angles bigger than 180°will be moduled by 180° when processing. this effect can also adding or removing twirls for better readability)</i>
