                    Each ADOFAI level may correspond to an curse effect <i>(theoretically)</i>. The IDs of the two are the same.<br/>
                    Using a curse effect may produces many possibilities of results. Just choose a specific one to use.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>In the following content, midspins will be considered as 0° angle.</p>
            <h3 id="General.Formats">Formats</h3>
            <p>
                The curses should be hinted by using text decorations on the bottom of the interface:
                <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: 12-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: XT-X</div><br/>
                <i>(and yes, that's why the name of this cursed levels series is <b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str">string</a></b>!)</i>
            </p>
                <p>
                    There will be a countdown before updating the current curse effects.<br/>
                    The countdown starts with 3, decreases by 1 in equal interval time.<br/>
                    The curse effects will be updated <b>at the exact same time</b> when the number <i>should be</i> counted down to -1.<br/>

                <h4 id="General.Mechanisms.Basics">Basics</h4>
                    <p>Curse effects is usually regarded as a chart-to-chart <b>mapping</b> at here.</p>
                    <p>
                        Curse effects can <b>stack</b>:
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: XR-X + 12-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 12-X + XR-X</div><br/>
                    </p>
                <h4 id="General.Mechanisms.Advanced">Advanced</h4>
                    <p>
                        The affect order of stacked curse effects is from left to right. For example:
                        <p>
                            <b>XR-X + 12-X</b> will first add triangles,<br/>
                            then try to change the angle of every tile,<br/>
                            including those tiles that is a part of these new triangle,<br/>
                            so now these triangles are probably not triangles anymore;<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            but <b>12-X + XR-X</b> will first try to change the angle of every tile,<br/>
                            then add triangles which will not be modified by the angle change process thats already finished.
                        </p>
                    </p>
                <h4 id="General.Mechanisms.Meta">Meta</h4>
                    <p>
                        Curse effects can also stack on themselves.
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: XS-X + XS-X + XS-X + XS-X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: XS-X<span class="curstr*">*</span>6</div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Anticurse</b> can be used to reverse the effect of a curse, as long as that part is possible to have an reversed version which is possible to form the current part if you use the original curse to it.<br/>
                        <div class="curstr">Current curse by Yangsy56302: 8<span class="curstr+">+</span>X<br/>Next curse by Yangsy56302: 9-X + 9<span class="curstr+">+</span>X</div><br/>
                        <i>(when i said reverse, i didn't mean simply negate the values, although it may be equivalent; i mean <b>negate the whole process</b>)</i><br/>
                        Using an anticurse may produces many possibilities of results which is totally different with the original chart, or does not match expectations at all. Just choose a specific one to use as I mentioned before.<br/>
