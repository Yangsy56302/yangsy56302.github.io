# Q&A between [@Jack-O_hedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/@Jack-O_hedgehog) and @Yangsy56302


[**How should `"1-X"⁻¹` work?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrBwA4wsXsY&lc=Ugxby0cdVR6tpTj5Fg14AaABAg)

same as `"1-X"`, since `"1-X"` is possible to use the restriction that every type of judgement is allowed, and `"1-X"` can be use after `"1-X"`

---

[**If `"T5-X"` doesn't exactly change anything about the title of a curse, can that title be interpreted differently?  
Like, for example, is there a chance that `"T5-X"(8-X?, "beat", "beat")` could create a 1 beat pause on each angled section?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA1VEmIn9fg&lc=Ugw3t9AtYmjVtBHjE2h4AaABAg)

good idea so yes :)

---

[**What should `"RJ-X"` do for multitap tiles that also have midspins?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK8Mkp1apdg&lc=UgyrdTPBQ0CR15ANUaR4AaABAg)

if the midspin itself is a multitap, locate the midspin to the tile right after it

**so**  
**⚪(🤍)⚪⚫ → ⚪🤍⚪🤍**  
**(⚪)⚫🤍⚫ → ⚪🤍🤍⚫**  
**?**

[..., 180, 90, (999), 90, 180, ...] -> [..., 180, 90, 999, 45, 999, 45, 180, ...]

---

[**Can `"T4-X"` place midspins on holds?  
If so, what would happen to the hold?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_RKhpySEY&lc=Ugxw4HA3dgzYjiIVjOF4AaABAg)

can't be done simply in editor, so can't be formed by `"T4-X"`  
( it could be an interesting mechanism if ever implemented :3 )

**What happened to the last hold in this level?**

left over from history, won't change the chart

---

[**are those suns from Minecraft?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_RKhpySEY&lc=Ugw0si9m9-QD12lsf-F4AaABAg)

yes in design

---

[**Should I put this in my cursed levels playlist?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8AFKbg3Uo&lc=UgzDgKDuZr-BqTUs8rl4AaABAg)

whatever

---

[**`"T3-E1"` = `<12-X3⁻¹` ?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugym3nhze6MLLq8qflZ4AaABAg)

`"T3-E1"` ⫋ `<12-X3⁻¹`

**?**

---

[**does `"ML-X"` depend on the initial tempo?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g69MM7wciEY&lc=UgxNFXcgjmnsHMIrhwR4AaABAg)

woah i forgor to add argument for that :0

---

[**Can you show inverted curses using `*-1` ?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhhVVMJLrcM&lc=Ugy1G6ZgC8LX4ZydQ314AaABAg)

if using `curse1 + curse2` format, yes  
if using `curse2(curse1(level))`, no; use `curse ^ -1` instead  

---

[**what if we made a graph out of a level and these curses?  
This idea is inspired by 2swap's video about making graphs of states of a puzzle about sliding blocks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgwpptRiCieACge4v_h4AaABAg)

not sure  
i do love 2swap's videos btw :3

---

[**I think i have an idea for showing which `XS-X` crab curse is happening  
put a pink heart on if it's from grafrustix  
put a green diamond on if it's from TQG  
or in curstr notation, it could look like `XS-X?(♡)` and `XS-X?(♢)`  
Kind of like the suits in a deck of cards**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh8vYN2t-p4&lc=UgysLcuqfVwyfzEYLhJ4AaABAg)

---

[**How should `"T3-E1"("T3-E7")` work?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgyU7fcNdlLE_LYhW-N4AaABAg)

hide half of the chart  
(if considering equalizing mentioned at `"T3-E1"` desc, kinda like a strip-colored track with 1 transparent color)

---

[**how would `"T3-E15"` work on the consecutive squares from XO-2 ?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzMy3ESNAylZ3uj-Kt4AaABAg)

choose the smallest one in tile order if there's a tie

**so it skips to the last square?**

uhhh no, it doesn't skip  
(should use the word "earliest" rather than "smallest", sorry)

**oh ok**

---

[**what would happen if the midspins were from austria instead?  
`"T5-X"("T4-EX", "al", "")`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDO1dS4HlI&lc=UgzNSbx9aO6uFEaFYkx4AaABAg)

there is no standard answer for this question :3

---

[**How would curse `"XR-X"` affect a 90° tile with a pause or hold?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA9aEeIcU28&lc=UgyJH3KNg486UIpovCJ4AaABAg)

only the 1st 90° tile inherits the properties of the original 90° tile; the 4th 90° tile is new added

---

[**I think the description is a Minecraft reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsIQK4JKN0E&lc=UgyKKmbQdyzK65n3Ij54AaABAg)

wait what

oh wait you're right, i didn't realize it at the time i sent the 1st reply

---

[**???**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhhVVMJLrcM&lc=Ugzm_HpBSymCYZvrN7l4AaABAg)

:3

---

[**how does curse `"T2-X"` change speeds when the midspins aren't exactly fire tiles or ice tiles?  
Like the orange and purple midspins in this level**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erH8yaNOyiU&lc=UgymSrbP4IpwEBp91P14AaABAg)

only the perfectly "middle" midspin won't change the speed  
others acts the same with the fire tiles or ice tiles (in amount), depends on which side that midspin is on

---

[**Does `"T3-E18"("T1-X")` make every hold have exactly one loop?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugzu24-BtAi02KtYJHZ4AaABAg)

exactly one **extra** loop

**so `"T1-X"` becomes `"T1-EX"` ?**

no; `"T1-EX"` set the new Duration value to `old Duration value + 1` but `"T3-E18"("T1-X")` set the new Duration value to `1`  
"extra hold loops" is the unit of Duration

---

[**Would the `7-X?` curse change the speeds to match the time it takes to pass the first tile of the cursed section, or would it change speeds based on the time it takes to pass a straight tile?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgwjOAI1_In_UMiO9294AaABAg)

what -- don't ask me, ask firestix instead :0

---

[**Does `"T3-E17"` also affect the section before the first turnaround and the section after the last turnaround?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxNzQVsJo-Ca6G9C3Z4AaABAg)

no

---

[**`C(L)` = 1  
`"T3-E1"(C)(L)` = 0.5  
`"T3-E1"("T3-E1"(C))(L)` = 0.25  
`"T3-E1"("T3-E1")(C)(L)` = 0.75**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgwQ73ytvJ0xB6z0FIl4AaABAg)

`True`

---

[**does `"T3-E18"²` increase the first number by two or does it increase the second number by one?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzPVURaslSX-L-cwWd4AaABAg)

good question, didn't define that what the order of arguments should be when using exponentation  
maybe this below?  
`"T3-E18"^2(obj1)(obj2)(level)` = `"T3-E18"^2(obj1, obj2, level)` = `"T3-E18"(obj1)("T3-E18"(obj2)(level))`

---

[**10:45 Why does the yellow midspin sound like an ice tile?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYemC-VF8Y&lc=UgxdM6bkqr3VEcBUiSp4AaABAg)

that was a mistake  
won't fix because can't upload to steam workshop

---

[**9:19 Is it just me or are the colors on the holds moving a little faster than normal?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYemC-VF8Y&lc=UgykDVyiz86vvfC26kx4AaABAg)

was recorded at higher speed because my old laptop was very laggy

was recorded at higher speed because my old laptop was very laggy  

---

[**Can `"10+X"` turn midspins into turnarounds?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYemC-VF8Y&lc=Ugxrm33l5p-E2hZIw7h4AaABAg)

sadly no, are you trying to find `"XM-X"`?  

**not really**  
**How exactly can't `"10+X"` turn midspins into turnarounds?**  
**Based on your definition of a midspin, the inverted version of curse `"10-X"` seems to me like it can turn some midspins into turnarounds**

uh that definition wasn't meant to works everywhere -- some of the angle-related curse would ignore those edge cases  
`"10-X"` is a example, which follows the original design for turnarounds and midspins of adofai  
treats `"10-X"` as a conditional `5-X?` with angles >180° might works  

---

[**is `"T3-E17"` basically `12-X?` but instead affecting sections between turnarounds?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgyRdy9gndL6i1Q2t0l4AaABAg)

yes (the amount of the repetion depends on the amount of the turnarounds)

---

[**if `"T3+EX"` is applied during a tutorial, would the following level replace the finish tile?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgyOcfr3iDYIRCdagRd4AaABAg)

1. insert, not replace
2. following tutorials, not levels  
(based on assumptions that if `"T3-EX"` is applied onto a tutorial, it can still split this tutorial level to multiple tutorial levels and make them belongs to the final non-tutorial level (the level which its description, portal and level icon image are actually used), and the new tutorials should be inserted after the `"T3-EX"`-affected tutorial)

---

[**Does curse `"3-X"` affect straight tiles even if they have midspins?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrBwA4wsXsY&lc=UgyQEXiYkSU_gcGJr8R4AaABAg)

midspins shouldn't be considered as a "very special type of tile" in most string curses process  
you can just imagine they are just 0 degrees angle with an hidden implicit single-tile-ranged 1-tile-offset autoplay event and most of the theory works (except that 60° angles with 3 planets scenario :|)  
so basically midspins on a was-180° tile can split the straight line into 2 segments and yeah

---

[**Do any curse series now have that curse that goes "but the straight lines have been rolled up into enclosed shapes"?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQjXTU421c&lc=UgxFVkAS4VjG3a386IJ4AaABAg)

idk

---

[**I think I have figured out how curse `XF-X?` works  
before: θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, θ₅, … θₙ₋₁, θₙ  
after: θ₁+30°, θ₂-60°, θ₃+60°, θ₄-60°, θ₅+60°, … θₙ₋₁∓60°, θₙ±60°**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQjXTU421c&lc=Ugxbfab3ghWi_cW82mN4AaABAg)

---

[**What can `12-X?` consider a loop?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxR7Enl4eFNPb2e7c14AaABAg)

not sure, maybe for tiles that their line forms closed shapes (and some extra tiles somehow)

**what if a text based representation of the affected track pieces were included in the notation? maybe something like this for example?**  
**current level: `12-X?(⊾(3)●○●○●○●○●○●○, ⊾(3)●○●●○●, ⊾(3)●●○●●○)(8-X)`**

good idea :)  
(although it's better to put all the track piece notations into a list (  
`12-X?([⊾(3)●○●○●○●○●○●○, ⊾(3)●○●●○●, ⊾(3)●●○●●○])(8-X)`  
) because of, currying problems, maybe)

---

[**Can you use just any number as the ∆BPM for tempo changing curses?  
I know that they usually use values that start with the `±` symbol to indicate that it can be positive or negative
but can you have the ∆BPM be only positive or only negative?  
like, can `"11-X"` cause ALL twirls to change the tempo by -5 if `∆BPM = -5` instead of ±5 ?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycYemC-VF8Y&lc=UgzoRmXCOCm84pfkwdp4AaABAg)

---

[**I wonder how fast a speed changing tile has to be to have a visible icon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzL87q0h_pCGDiycp14AaABAg)

maybe `10%` ? not sure :/

---

[**Which section do you think is the hardest?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxYtXtVI_ENhFAULVB4AaABAg)

hard to say, i can't beat it anyway

---

[**what happens when `"T5-X"` tries to replace a phrase that appears multiple times in another curse's description?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riC7nUC-vVo&lc=Ugw0p7iZ1pJIN7Ekobh4AaABAg)

replace all of them  
(use `"T5-X"("T5-X", ..., ...)` to make custom filters lol)

---

[**Does curse `"T3-E10"` affect speed changes that aren't visible, like from the `6-X?` curse?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugx_66Y3_WK9eQMnm814AaABAg)

no

---

[**how would curse `<12-X3` look in your notation?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgyeqNur8yKULvDSdRZ4AaABAg)

`<12-X3(curse)`  
or maybe `<12-X3(*True if buff else None*, curse)`

**so**  
**`<12-X3(false, "XT-X")` does nothing?**

---

[**when `XS-X?` is applied, which one do I use?  
there are two  
one removes tempo changes  
the other twists the shapes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxBgWBPp0_wiEmqxlN4AaABAg)

should note that which unofficial crab is applying there

**how about this?**  
**`XS-X?♡` removes tempo changes**  
**`XS-X?♢` twists the shapes**

---

[**¿**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0APbXrgMw&lc=Ugy6Yfu9eLVnI_KjziZ4AaABAg)

---

[**5:00 do I see a cross on that mine?  
I may be wrong, but I think that's supposed to be `1-EX*`, which I think is supposed to turn 90° tiles and 270° tiles into multitap turnarounds, but I don't see any multitaps.  
Also, it says `1-X*` in the bottom instead of `1-EX*`  
I think you used the wrong image**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzIHDqSdVGesXFselB4AaABAg)

it's hotfix time

fixed

---

[**curse combination idea:  
`"T4-EX" + "T3-E5" + MN-X*`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugysga1yR_aIo5NfItB4AaABAg)

welp it's too late

**oh well**

---

[**What does `T3-E2` mean by "one"?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgwSBOUVk-kACgPbLGF4AaABAg)

1st one -> Holds  
2nd one -> midspins

---

[**6:46 did you forget an "E"?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgyIdbjyx0HfDRM1XGN4AaABAg)

OH

---

[**I don't think I understand what curse `"T3-E17"` or `"T3-E18"` exactly do**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxFV9MEoIVXnxhp21F4AaABAg)

[https://yangsy56302.github.io/adofai/curstr/e.html#T3-E17](https://yangsy56302.github.io/adofai/cursed/string/e.html#T3-E17)

---

[**`-##-#` ?  
`##-#<` ?  
what are those curse series**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugx8mrQohDWoyrfv3al4AaABAg)

Negative (or dash, to remove ambiguity between Inverted curses);  
Fish

**Apparently `-3-X` adds a twirl after every three point turn**  
**So, which `3-X` curse is being inverted?**

if a twirl is after a three point turn, it may disappear

**I am not asking what happens if `-3-X` is inverted**  
**you said `-##-#` meant negative, but what about `- ##-#` or `##+#` or `##-#⁻¹`**

OH, that's the positive version of the curse -- their names are "negative curses". it's confusing :|

---

[**what does `9-X!` do?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxvPrV3AbhT1eOO_SB4AaABAg)

all enclosed shapes are squares  
i thought it's obivious but it seems it's not :(

**oh oops**  
**at the time i posted that comment, I didn't know what curse "T3-E13" did, so i didn't think of looking at the top**

---

[**what math operation is the circle supposed to represent**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxMmNmH_45M97cwXRx4AaABAg.ALD5qCdgK2iALLOM7XgMbZ)

`g∘f(x)` = `g(f(x))`

---

[**5:55 what does `#FFF600` do??**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzBm2x0dho6qD-meeN4AaABAg)

remove segments that's too fast / too slow  
(i'm not sure where exactly are the boundaries, so i decided to remove the parts which would display the rabbit / snail icons)

also that curse isn't level bounded, strongly recommend that to use a similar method to create curses to avoid being restricted by the order of levels

---

[**5:24 what does `○` mean  
oh i see**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxmwHjorj96YUleKsp4AaABAg)

---

[**what are the parentheses doing  
oh i see**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=Ugzgw59RTCthPXfzsdZ4AaABAg)

---

[**does `T3-E5` mirror the midspins?  
⚪🤍⚫⚫⚪ → ⚪⚫⚫🤍⚪  
oh right, it says so in the title**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgzNnoNqsg9h8U6DH3p4AaABAg)

---

[**4:44 whatt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-SS0MDip4Y&lc=UgxylnTbNCP33it33CB4AaABAg)

stacking curses at ABS!! the 2nd time :3

---

[**When curse `"XR-X"` is active, will it turn 90° tiles into triangles if there is an outside triangle beside the 90° tile?  
like for example the one in `XS-X`**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=UgxhNXXHhkHboeLw_GB4AaABAg)

the 90° must be a corner of a triangle to avoid `"XR-X"` affection

---

[**I finally recreated all of the official levels as text, so I think I will start recreating cursed levels.  
Which cursed level do you think I should recreate as text first?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA1VEmIn9fg&lc=UgwDKx8bmBNJSYuEaox4AaABAg)

i... am not sure

**Maybe I will start with the crab cursed levels**

---

[**Should I add this to my cursed level playlist?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGpVDh6EUIY&lc=Ugz0cL4ysUf1ug8nhuZ4AaABAg)

uhhh no

---

[**Which curse was the one that turned enclosed shapes into turnarounds?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGpVDh6EUIY&lc=UgzG_uupOHypBU1EXAN4AaABAg)

for the scene of `"T3-E17"`: not a single curse did. it was probably an illusion when the `1-X*` (turning 90° adn 270° into turnarounds) cursed the `12-X*` (adding squares), so the range of `1-X*` were restricted into those squares ;3  
for the level in this video: what do you mean, it's a cuse-unrelated-level :|  
for a pure answer: `PA-X*`  

**thanks**

---

[**`XN-X + XN+X` is powerful  
I am sure it has the possibility of setting the amount of planets to TWENTY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g69MM7wciEY&lc=UgzpIzVzzagXOKheIDt4AaABAg)

YES but it's hard to make the chart :(

[**the second last section of this level has speeds that are similar to the speeds in "No distance", Is that a coincidence?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK8Mkp1apdg&lc=UgxFkjHtk9wQ1jVF2yR4AaABAg)

uhhh yes

[**is that a solar eclipse**](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxmosE9bwqcxLthZVdLTG58Wo84rwAm9wt?lc=UgxCNf321z6GeWLodQJ4AaABAg)

similar but no, the palette was referenced from imaginary blackhole images (and emerald). also the outer ring isn't a space object -- it only glows on 1 side

---

[**i wonder what happens to your curses when their effects are doubled by the `<12-X3` curse  
Could `"XN-X" + <12-X3` give you four planets?  
Would `"XR-X" + <12-X3` turn 90° tiles into triangles even if those 90° tiles are already beside a triangle?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erH8yaNOyiU&lc=Ugw8jyLjCb0OxDvhHXd4AaABAg)

1. I'm not sure. that depends on how did `12-X` Miss-Qing-curse defined
2. probably yes

---

[**A lot of PA-X's twirls are missing, what happened to them?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=Ugx3T7Hol1gpZML7ygB4AaABAg)

i just ignored them :/

---

[**1:35 where's the yellow gem tile**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA9aEeIcU28&lc=UgyKydu2T4nWma_1WwF4AaABAg)

OH MY (since i don't believe in god, uhhhh, MONIKA???) YOU'RE RIGHT :O  
the set obj event still exists but the decoration was gone somehow, that's weird :/

[**I have three questions about your curses ( i also commented the questions on your curstr part 3 video )  
here are the questions :**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZcw15rsVpg&lc=Ugz4j9HRTFiiyNk1azt4AaABAg)  
1. **When `"XN-X"*2` is active, do you get 4 planets?**
2. **Does curse `"RJ-X"` curse turn triple taps into tiles with two midspins?**
3. **Does curse `"MN+X"` have the same effect as curse `"PA-X"`?**
<!-- -->
1. No, it's still 3 planets
2. Yes; Same with `-"RJ-X"` but backwards
3. According to the definition of the inverted curses, Yes

---

[**does curse `"MN+X"` have the same effect as curse `"PA-X"`?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=UgxCGEYUokQPMWI-vZV4AaABAg)

Yes -- wait you asked this question at 2 places???

**Are you talking about my comment on your swapped curses part 4 video? if no, then I don't know**

yes

---

[**What happens to midspins when curse `"6-X"` is active?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrBwA4wsXsY&lc=UgzeysMkuFAIStGcbLp4AaABAg)

still put the pauses on every tile as long as the midspin doesn't have in-game bugs with them

---

[**does your `RJ-X` curse turn triple taps into tiles with two midspins?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=UgxsuF7CIvp9mKQmkEl4AaABAg)

yep

why isn't the `"T2-X"` curse changing the speed**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPG4GkiW9Rs&lc=Ugz2RrVKxvNl77SvrV14AaABAg)

the old setting of `"T2-X"` allows that it only changes the midspin color. i know it's a bad design so i never do that after i start to remake curstr levels, also that's 1 of the reason why i abandoned this version of `T3-X` string cursed level :(  
and if i must use the current definitions for `"T2-X"` effect to explain this... the speed did changed by 0 ??? :/

also you are really keen, a lot of bugs were found by you, so good job + thank you :D

**Thanks + You're welcome :D**

[**I have a question about your `"XS+X"` curse.  
⚪⚫🟣⚫⚪⚫⚪⚫  
What happens when curse `"XS+X"` starts being applied at the tile with a twirl(shown in the emojis above)?  
Does the twirl get moved to the tile before? Does the twirl not get moved? Does the twirl disappear?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQjXTU421c&lc=Ugypa-6LX_XIXOYcsSl4AaABAg)

[**1:41  
why aren't some of the straight tiles being affected by curse `"ML+X"`?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g69MM7wciEY&lc=UgzLnTFW5c6MMxy32gx4AaABAg)

i chose the same shape of track as the uncursed in some segments.  
this **technically** still met the conditions since `"ML-X"` wouldn't make **visible** changes in track shape on segments that's already equalized :3

[**How do you get the images for the curses?  
for example maybe the `8-X?` curse**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQjXTU421c&lc=UgzqeVKnjEwh-OJaMup4AaABAg)

either from workshop file or curse maker themselves

**I don't know where to find the workshop file**

(the directory that steam.exe is located at) /steamapps/workshop/content/977950 (the game id of adofai on steam) / (the workshop id of adofai world on steam)

**Thank you!!**

[**I thought curse `XF-X` was supposed to use shortcuts  
What happened to ut**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGQjXTU421c&lc=UgwFs33hMqvbOj2Ba_p4AaABAg)

`-XF-X` is an alias for `XF+X`

[**When the `RJ+X` curse is active, does it matter where the midspin is on a tile for it to be turned into a multitap?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=UgyjDFfDl3OZ9gnX1b94AaABAg)

**Like, I know that ⚪⚫⚫🤍⚫⚫ will turn into (⚪)⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫ but what about ⚪🤍⚫⚫⚫⚫ or ⚪⚫⚫⚫🤍⚫**

it does not matter  
(although i always put the midspin from `RJ-X` actually at middle of the tile, it's not necessary; it's just a default behavior)

**Also, what happens if there are multiple midspins on one tile when `RJ+X` is active?**

2 midspins = triple hit, 3 midspins = quadruple hit, and so on

[**0:48 accidental `T4EX-X` curse?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g69MM7wciEY&lc=Ugznj9l7SQ0eW0whjpN4AaABAg)

what does "accidental" actually mean, is it that i forgot to add `T4-EX`, or the curse combo made a result that looks like `T4-EX`'s result? i don't quite understand that, sorry :/

**I don't know why i am saying that**

**I don't know why I am saying that**

[**i am guessing `XN-X + XN+X` can give you ANY amount of planets  
because if you have a 4 planet section, applying `"XN-X"` would turn into 3 planets**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKYccn41Nw&lc=Ugxh2tcuKQPCIiZ00Dd4AaABAg.AIvaa6_xZA3AL-XOuE-QfG)
